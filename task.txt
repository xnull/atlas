POI Service

Your task is to design and create POI service and REST API using either Node.js or Java.

In navigation systems it’s usual to search for interesting objects near your current location.
POI (point of interest) has geocoordinates, floor number and various other parameters.
Your task is to decide the other features of a POI (two at least).
The POIs can be queried using these features.
Examples of POIs include: your friend’s current location (dynamic) and the nearest elevator (static).

- A REST API for adding POIs. Adding a new POI is computationally expensive operation (for sake of the task)
  and should be done asynchronously, ie. out of request-response loop.
- A REST API for querying POIs using location and optionally other query parameters.
- Document the data models exposed through the REST API and the API itself.
- A REST API should use HTTP Basic Authentication
- Justify your technology choices.

Please store the code to Github or Bitbucket (or similar) and provide us access to the repo.
You should also include instructions how to run the application.
